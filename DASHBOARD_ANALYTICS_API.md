## API Endpoints

### 1. Get Dashboard Analytics Data

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/admin/dashboard/analytics`

**Description:** Retrieves comprehensive analytics data for dashboard visualizations including attendance trends, revenue analysis, enrollment statistics, payment status, complaints, subscriptions, and staff performance.

**Query Parameters:**
- `period` (optional): Time period for data
  - `this-week` - Last 7 days
  - `this-month` - Current month (default)
  - `last-month` - Previous month
  - `this-year` - Current year

**Request Example:**
```bash
# Without parameters (defaults to this-month)
GET http://localhost:5001/api/admin/dashboard/analytics

# With period parameter
GET http://localhost:5001/api/admin/dashboard/analytics?period=this-week

## Backend Implementation Guide

### Database Queries

#### 1. Attendance Trends
```sql

  SUM(amount) - COALESCE((SELECT SUM(amount) FROM expenses WHERE MONTH(expense_date) = MONTH(p.payment_date)), 0) as profit
FROM payments p
WHERE payment_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 6 MONTH)
  AND status = 'paid'
GROUP BY MONTH(payment_date), YEAR(payment_date)
ORDER BY payment_date DESC
LIMIT 6;
```

#### 3. Enrollment Data
```sql
-- Get monthly enrollment statistics
SELECT 
  DATE_FORMAT(enrollment_date, '%b %Y') as month,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN enrollment_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY) THEN 1 END) as enrolled,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'withdrawn' AND updated_at >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY) THEN 1 END) as withdrawn,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'active' THEN 1 END) as active
FROM children
GROUP BY MONTH(enrollment_date), YEAR(enrollment_date)
ORDER BY enrollment_date DESC
LIMIT 6;
```

#### 4. Payment Status
```sql
-- Get payment status breakdown
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'paid' THEN 1 END) as paid,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'unpaid' THEN 1 END) as unpaid,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'unpaid' AND due_date < CURDATE() THEN 1 END) as overdue,
  COUNT(*) as total
FROM payments
WHERE payment_date >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 1 MONTH);
```

#### 5. Complaint Statistics
```sql
-- Get complaint status breakdown
SELECT 
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'pending' THEN 1 END) as pending,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'resolved' THEN 1 END) as resolved,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN status = 'in_progress' THEN 1 END) as inProgress,
  COUNT(*) as total
FROM complaints;
```

#### 6. Subscription Breakdown
```sql
-- Get subscription plan breakdown with revenue
SELECT 
  sp.plan_name as planName,
  COUNT(s.subscription_id) as count,
  SUM(sp.price) as revenue
FROM subscriptions s
JOIN subscription_plans sp ON s.plan_id = sp.plan_id
WHERE s.status = 'active'
GROUP BY sp.plan_id, sp.plan_name
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
```

#### 7. Staff Performance
```sql
-- Get staff performance metrics
SELECT 
  u.user_name as staffName,
  u.role,
  COUNT(a.activity_id) as activitiesCount,
  COALESCE(AVG(r.rating), 0) as rating
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN activities a ON u.user_id = a.user_id AND a.created_at >= DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
LEFT JOIN ratings r ON u.user_id = r.user_id
WHERE u.role IN ('teacher', 'supervisor')
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.user_name, u.role
ORDER BY activitiesCount DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Node.js Controller Example

```javascript

    if (period === 'last-month') dateCondition = 'DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 60 DAY)';
    if (period === 'this-year') dateCondition = 'DATE_SUB(CURDATE(), INTERVAL 365 DAY)';

    // Execute all queries in parallel

## Route Setup

```javascript
// routes/dashboardRoutes.js
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();
const analyticsController = require('../controllers/dashboardAnalyticsController');

// Analytics endpoint (no authentication required)
router.get('/analytics', analyticsController.getAnalytics);

module.exports = router;
```

---

## Testing

### Using cURL
```bash
# Test analytics endpoint
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5001/api/admin/dashboard/analytics?period=this-month" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"

# Test with different period
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5001/api/admin/dashboard/analytics?period=this-week" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Using JavaScript/Frontend
```javascript
// Fetch analytics data
const fetchAnalytics = async (period = 'this-month') => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(
      `http://localhost:5001/api/admin/dashboard/analytics?period=${period}`,
      {
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }
      }
    );
    
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log('Analytics:', data);
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
};
```

## Decision-Making Insights

### Key Metrics for Management

1. **Revenue Trends** - Track income vs expenses to identify profitable months
2. **Payment Status** - Monitor overdue payments for cash flow management
3. **Attendance Trends** - Identify patterns for staffing decisions
4. **Peak Hours** - Optimize staff scheduling based on busy periods
5. **Enrollment Data** - Track growth and withdrawal rates
6. **Subscription Breakdown** - Identify most popular plans
7. **Staff Performance** - Recognize top performers and training needs
8. **Complaint Stats** - Monitor service quality and response times

### Actionable Insights

- **High overdue payments** â†’ Follow up with parents, send reminders
- **Low attendance trends** â†’ Investigate reasons, improve engagement
- **Peak hour bottlenecks** â†’ Increase staff during busy times
- **Popular subscription plans** â†’ Focus marketing on successful offerings
- **Pending complaints** â†’ Prioritize resolution to maintain quality
- **Staff performance gaps** â†’ Provide training and support

## Notes

- All queries are optimized for performance with proper indexes
- Data is aggregated to reduce payload size
- Frontend includes loading states for better UX
- No authentication required - direct database access
- Period parameter allows flexible time-based filtering
- Charts can be integrated using libraries like Chart.js or Recharts
